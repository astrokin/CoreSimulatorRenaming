CoreSimulatorRenaming
=====================

Script will add additional file to the particular core simulator's folder.

1. Open terminal app
2. put sh identifire.sh
3. press Enter

Open with Finder at /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices and you will easily understand what iOS simulator are you looking through

:) Don't be serious - it's my first ever script.
